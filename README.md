AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice
This project presents an AI-powered agent designed to support small-scale farmers with real-time, localized agricultural advice. Built using IBM Cloud Lite and powered by IBM Granite Foundation Models, the agent leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer farming queries based on structured data, trusted content sources, and live web retrievals.

->Project Objective
The aim is to create an AI agent that:

Provides personalized crop guidance based on region, soil, and weather.

Suggests fertilizer usage, water management, and organic practices.

Delivers real-time mandi (market) prices for crops.

Helps farmers understand government schemes, livestock care, and digital farming tools.

->Technologies Used
IBM Cloud Lite – Backend infrastructure and deployment platform.

IBM Granite – Language model used for generating natural, contextual responses.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Combines document/context retrieval with AI-generated answers.

Vector Indexing – Used to store and retrieve farming documents for accurate context matching.

Web Tools (e.g., Google Search) – Access live weather, market, and scheme updates when data is unavailable in the index.

->Core Features
Responds to crop-related questions like “Is it a good time to plant rice in Vijayawada?”

Fetches or estimates current crop prices (e.g., tomato, onion, paddy).

Interprets weather forecasts to provide actionable advice.

Accesses fallback strategies when live tools fail (e.g., using historical price trends).

Uses natural language, avoiding complex jargon, making it easy for farmers to understand.

->Future Scope
Integrate voice input/output for vernacular access.

Add satellite imagery analysis for crop health monitoring.

Build a mobile interface for wider accessibility.

Expand to support more languages and local dialects.

Include crop insurance calculators and credit eligibility tools.
